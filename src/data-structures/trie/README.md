#Trie

A trie, also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search treeâ€”an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. 

**Pros**
- An efficient data structure for searching words in dictionaries, search complexity with Trie is linear in terms of word (or key) length to be searched.
- Can efficiently do prefix search (or auto-complete).
- Can insert and find strings in O(L) time where L represent the length of a single word. This is faster BST.
- There are no collisions of different keys in a trie. So worst case time complexity is O(n)
- Buckets in a trie, which are analogous to hash table buckets that store key collisions, are necessary only if a single key is associated with more than one value.
- There is no need to provide a hash function or to change hash functions as more keys are added to a trie.
- A trie can provide an alphabetical ordering of the entries by key.
- Some tries can require more space than a hash table, as memory may be allocated for each character in the search string, rather than a single chunk of memory for the whole entry, as in most hash tables.

**Cons**
- Trie lookup can be slower than hash table lookup, especially if the data is directly accessed on a hard disk drive or some other secondary storage device where the random-access time is high compared to main memory.
- Some keys, such as floating point numbers, can lead to long chains and prefixes that are not particularly meaningful. Nevertheless, a bitwise trie can handle standard IEEE single and double format floating point numbers.
- Some tries can require more space than a hash table, as memory may be allocated for each character in the search string, rather than a single chunk of memory for the whole entry, as in most hash tables.
